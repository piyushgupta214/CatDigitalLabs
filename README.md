# Initial Thoughts 
## Requirements
***
This PoC can be divided into three pages

* #### Home Screen 
* #### Categories/Sub-Categores Screen
* #### Result Screen

***
## Key Highlights
***
### Application Footer has 4 tabs

* #### Request Equipment 
* #### Active Rentals
* #### Open Requests
* #### My yards
***
### Application Header has title and phone option 
* It seems back button at top left corner should be redundant at Home Page/Parent Page, should be more useful when we are diggin into the nested pages[master - detail pages].

    * Header 
    * Feature Equipment Section
    * Choose Rental Store Section

* #### Categories/Sub-Categores Scree

    * Should have 4 tabs at footer
